 Patch Notes:

*** Made the Class finder more intuitive ***
 - 1. The "Student Profile" Filter Bar 🎨
Instead of tiny checkboxes, let's use "Choice Chips" (large, clickable buttons). This mentally shifts the task from "filtering a database" to "describing the student."

Current: [ ] English [ ] Online (Small, easy to miss) New: [ 🇺🇸 English ] [ 🇷🇺 Russian ] [ 💻 Online ] (Big, tactile targets)

2. Visual Hierarchy in the Grid 📊
Right now, "Booked" (Red) screams for attention just as much as "Open" (Blue).

Change: We will fade out the "Booked" slots significantly. We want the Open slots to pop.

Addition: If a Group Class is available, we will give it a distinct "Gold/Green" border or icon so it stands out immediately as a "Money Saver" option for the student.

3. The "Split-Decision" Modal 🧠
When you click a slot, the current list is just a stack of buttons.

Change: We will split the modal into two distinct columns: "Join a Group" (Left) vs "Create Individual" (Right). This makes the decision instant.

*** Updated the Classes tab ***

Refactor renderClassList(): Group the classes by dayTimes and days.

Redesign renderClassCard(): Make the card shorter and add the Schedule as the top headline.

Optimize the Filters: We will make the filters instantly apply.
